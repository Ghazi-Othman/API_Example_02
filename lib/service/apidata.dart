  Sure I could make the url like : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users .... but in case like

  in one var and the rest of it in another vars 

  I used the http library to send request to the API and get resopnse 
  There is another library which is Dio

  Now ..... the function getUserData ... the return type is Future because our data will late to arrive 
  and List<UserModeL> because that is the type of our json response 
  I made a model to convert the json response 
  I used try and catch just in case any error will apper 
  
  The get function in http library ... take a parameter of type Uri 
  so i made a var url and parse the string (baseUrl+endPoints) .... the parse function take a string 

  I used await with the response ..... then I convert it to a (List of Objects) of my model (UserModel) and returned it in case no error happend

  That's all about Api file
